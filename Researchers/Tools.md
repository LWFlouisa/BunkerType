## Tools
This will break down the use case for each tool as I release them. The follow here is covered under a more permissive license, but you also assume all risk for experimenting with these. A lot of these blue the line between AI development and traditional game development, by applying statistical analyses to game development. Certain stuff like Beast classification will eventually bedirectly implemented in game, while "Needs Programming" will mostly be developer tools. Item classification iteratively calculates the probability of an item classification at run time.

## Needs Programming
Needs programming is a reminder system for tracking how state changes are made, and for predicting what game state you need to account for.

## Disconfirmative
This uses reasoning and naive bayes to determine whether something is confirmative or disconfirmative.

## Beast classification
This tool aids with classifying beasts.

## Dreamlike Intersections
Measures the intersections between sections of a dream that aren't clearly defined.

## Reconstructive Naive Bayes
Gathers statistics about reconstructed datasets.

## Item Classification
This can be foudn in Shuffle, Iterate, and Sort. It shuffles and matches to an index of standard items, then applies classifications to each matched item.

## Movement History
This tracks how often you've previously moved in X or Y coordinate directons, such as the play tracking previous moves.
