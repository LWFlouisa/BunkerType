## Propetiary Permissive
Here I will release the compiled binaries of my source code, which you agree to not decompile and incorporate into your own proprietary software. Permissions are granted to for open collaboration on public wiki pages under the terms of the CC-SA-NC-ND agreement.

Things not permitted include repurposing the source code for promoting far-right agendas and disinformation, covering by not limited to using against left-wing content creators, such as developing derivitive works that are used to further developme this beyond the original intended function. And updates to the wiki must be under the same terms of this agreement.

For commercial uses, this software is proprietary. But Wiki editing under the provisions of CC-BY-NC-ND.

## Research
Research is for stuff that's being actively worked on that might be risky to implement in a standard release package. A lot of this stuff blurs the line between traditional AI and Enemy Behaviours. The challenge has been to find something that bridges the gap between deterministic and random behaviours. The goal here isn't necessarily to simulate "thought" like living systems, but rather improve the way video game AI works.
